Watson X Wayback
================

Using IBM Watson's AlchemyLanguage API, I parse any webpage's plain text from WaybackMachine's archives.
This is then filtered by Watson's tone analyzer which returns the emotional composition of the webpage.
Watson generalizes tone in 5 emotions: Anger, Disgust, Fear, Joy, and Sadness.
